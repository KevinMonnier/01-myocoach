## Contexte
The MyoCoach is a device for upper limb amputees who wish to wear a myoelectric prosthesis. It allows you to practice the contraction of the forearm muscles thanks to a video game inspired by Flappy Bird, and to train the control of the future prosthesis. 

The MyoCoach can also be used by health professionals, particularly prosthetist (CPO) and occupational therapists, as it allows the myoelectric sensors to be placed correctly and adjusted for optimal use of myoelectric prostheses. 

The MyoCoach makes it possible to :

* Measure muscle potential with the help of myoelectric sensors
* Define the optimal sensor position
* Adjusting the sensors using potentiometers 
* Exercise in muscle contraction and coordination


## D.I.Y

You can design the MyoCoach for less than [30€](PriceTransparency.md) by following the manual of manufacturing [LINK]() and programming of the [Desktop GUI](src/software/gui/README.md) and the [Arduino Board](src/software/arduino/README.md)


The MyoCoach is made up of different elements :

* 2 EMG sensors to read the patient's myoelectric signals (EMG)
* 1 box to transfer data to the computer
* A holder to hold the sensors on the patient's arm

> Today, the MyoCoach uses sensors from the brand [Ottobock (Ref 13E202)](https://shop.ottobock.us/Prosthetics/Upper-Limb-Prosthetics/Myo-Hands-and-Components/Myo-Control-Elements/Electrodes/Suction-Socket-Electrode/p/13E202~560)]. Un jour, One day, **ORTHOPUS** will propose one, but not at the price of 1000€ !

All the details to make the best use of the MyoCoach can be found in the User Manual [LINK]()
